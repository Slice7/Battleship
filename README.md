## How to run the game
Simply open the .py file with python, either by right-clicking it or navigating to its directory in the command line.  
Or, if you prefer, open it with the IDE of your choice and run from there.

## How to play
Enter the coordinates in the form x,y to guess where the ship is on a 5x5 grid.

You have 5 tries, otherwise it's game over.

The game will let you know if your current guess is better or worse than your best guess, or if it's just as good.

If you guess a coordinate twice, you'll be notified, and you won't have spent a turn.
